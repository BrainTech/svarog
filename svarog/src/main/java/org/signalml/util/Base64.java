/**
 * Implements Base64 encoding and decoding as defined by RFC 2045: "Multipurpose Internet
 * Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies" page 23.
 * More information about this class is available from <a target="_top" href=
 * "http://ostermiller.org/utils/Base64.html">ostermiller.org</a>.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>The Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding is designed to represent
 * arbitrary sequences of octets in a form that need not be humanly
 * readable.  The encoding and decoding algorithms are simple, but the
 * encoded data are consistently only about 33 percent larger than the
 * unencoded data.  This encoding is virtually identical to the one used
 * in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) applications, as defined in RFC 1421.</p>
 *
 * <p>A 65-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
 * represented per printable character. (The extra 65th character, "=",
 * is used to signify a special processing function.)</p>
 *
 * <p>NOTE:  This subset has the important property that it is represented
 * identically in all versions of ISO 646, including US-ASCII, and all
 * characters in the subset are also represented identically in all
 * versions of EBCDIC. Other popular encodings, such as the encoding
 * used by the uuencode utility, Macintosh binhex 4.0 [RFC-1741], and
 * the base85 encoding specified as part of Level 2 PostScript, do no
 * share these properties, and thus do not fulfill the portability
 * requirements a binary transport encoding for mail must meet.</p>
 *
 * <p>The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
 * strings of 4 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to right, a
 * 24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8bit input groups.
 * These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit groups, each
 * of which is translated into a single digit in the base64 alphabet.
 * When encoding a bit stream via the base64 encoding, the bit stream
 * must be presumed to be ordered with the most-significant-bit first.
 * That is, the first bit in the stream will be the high-order bit in
 * the first 8bit byte, and the eighth bit will be the low-order bit in
 * the first 8bit byte, and so on.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each 6-bit group is used as an index into an array of 64 printable
 * characters.  The character referenced by the index is placed in the
 * output string.  These characters, identified in Table 1, below, are
 * selected so as to be universally representable, and the set excludes
 * characters with particular significance to SMTP (e.g., ".", CR, LF)
 * and to the multipart boundary delimiters defined in RFC 2046 (e.g.,
 * "-").</p>

 *      12 M            29 d            46 u            63 /

 *      16 Q            33 h            50 y
 * </pre>
 * <p>The encoded output stream must be represented in lines of no more
 * than 76 characters each.  All line breaks or other characters no
 * found in Table 1 must be ignored by decoding software.  In base64
 * data, characters other than those in Table 1, line breaks, and other
 * white space probably indicate a transmission error, about which a
 * warning message or even a message rejection might be appropriate
 * under some circumstances.</p>
 *
 * <p>Special processing is performed if fewer than 24 bits are available
 * at the end of the data being encoded.  A full encoding quantum is
 * always completed at the end of a body.  When fewer than 24 input bits
 * are available in an input group, zero bits are added (on the right)
 * to form an integral number of 6-bit groups.  Padding at the end of
 * the data is performed using the "=" character.  Since all base64
 * input is an integral number of octets, only the following cases can
 * arise: (1) the final quantum of encoding input is an integral
 * multiple of 24 bits; here, the final unit of encoded output will be
 * an integral multiple of 4 characters with no "=" padding, (2) the
 * final quantum of encoding input is exactly 8 bits; here, the final
 * unit of encoded output will be two characters followed by two "="
 * padding characters, or (3) the final quantum of encoding input is
 * exactly 16 bits; here, the final unit of encoded output will be three
 * characters followed by one "=" padding character.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because it is used only for padding at the end of the data, the
 * occurrence of any "=" characters may be taken as evidence that the
 * end of the data has been reached (without truncation in transit).  No
 * such assurance is possible, however, when the number of octets
 * transmitted was a multiple of three and no "=" characters are
 * present.</p>
 *
 * <p>Any characters outside of the base64 alphabet are to be ignored in
 * base64-encoded data.</p>
 *
 * <p>Care must be taken to use the proper octets for line breaks if base64
 * encoding is applied directly to text material that has not been
 * converted to canonical form.  In particular, text line breaks must be
 * converted into CRLF sequences prior to base64 encoding.  The
 * important thing to note is that this may be done directly by the
 * encoder rather than in a prior canonicalization step in some
 * implementations.</p>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: There is no need to worry about quoting potential boundary
 * delimiters within base64-encoded bodies within multipart entities
 * because no hyphen characters are used in the base64 encoding.</p>
