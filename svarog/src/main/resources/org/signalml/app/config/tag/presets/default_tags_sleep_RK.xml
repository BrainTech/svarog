      <tagItem name="1" description="Stage 1 is defined by relatively low voltage, mixed frequency EEG with a prominence of activity in the 2-7 Hz range.

      <tagItem name="2" description="Stage 2 is defined by the presence of sleep spindles and/or K complexes and the absence of sufficient high amplitude, slow activity ti define the presence of Stages 3 and 4." fillColor="ffffff" outlineColor="ffffff" outlineWidth="1.0" outlineDash="" keyShortcut="2" marker="0" visible="1"/>
      <tagItem name="3" description="Stage 3 is defined by an EEG record in which at least 20% but no more than 50% of the epoch consists of waves of 2 cps or slower which have amplitudes greater than 75 µV from peak to peak." fillColor="ffffff" outlineColor="ffffff" outlineWidth="1.0" outlineDash="" keyShortcut="3" marker="0" visible="1"/>

Assigned to epochs which immediately precede or follow sleep stages, but in which the EEG and EOG tracings are obscured in more than a half of the epoch by muscle tension and/or amplifier blocking artifacts associated with movement of the subject. MT should not be confused with the scoring of discrete body movements which can be of relatively short duration." fillColor="ffffff" outlineColor="ffffff" outlineWidth="1.0" outlineDash="" keyShortcut="M" marker="0" visible="1"/>
