            <dt>ERP</dt><dd> (<i>Event-Related Potential</i>) 
                opens a window allowing to plot average EEG responses synchronized to repetitive stimuli. For this purpose 
                we need an exact information about the instants of stimuli presentation. This information is recorded in 
                <A HREF="tags.html">tags</a>. In this window we choose tags corresponding to the stimuli of interest,
                range of the signal (time and derivations), filtering, montage and ev. artifacts rejection (if there are tags
                marking artifacts).</dd>

            <dt>Short-Time Fourier Transform</dt>
            <dd><i>STFT</i> is the basic approximation of signal's energy density in the time-frequency plane. 
                Depends on the type and width of the window (selectable).

            <dt>Wavelet transform</dt>
            <dd>
                <i>WT</i> is another time-frequency estimate of the signal's energy density, based on products with the mother wavelet, 
                scaled (which implies change of central frequency) and translated.
                In Svarog we can use Morlet, Shannon and Haar wavelets.

            <dt>Independent Component Analysis</dt>
            <dd><i>ICA</i> provides decomposition of mutivariate (multichannel) signal into components as independent as possible.

            <dt>Directed Transfer Function</dt>
            <dd>
                <i>DTF</i> is an estimate of the Granger causality in multivariate time series, based upon multivariate AR model (MVAR).
