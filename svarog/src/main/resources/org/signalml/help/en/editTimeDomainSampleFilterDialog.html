            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>This file describes how to create and edit time domain sample filters using
                Edit time domain sample filter dialog.</p>

            <h2>Specifying filter parameters</h2>

            <p>To create or edit a filter, you need to specify the following parameters:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Filter type</b> - describes what type of filter you want to design.<br/>
                    Possible values:
                    <ul>
                        <li>low-pass</li>
                        <li>high-pass</li>
                        <li>band-pass</li>
                        <li>band-stop</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Filter family</b> - is the type of approximation
                    function which will be used to design this filter.<br/>
                    Possible values:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Butterworth</li>
                        <li>Chebyshev I</li>
                        <li>Chebyshev II</li>
                        <li>Elliptic</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Passband edge frequency 1</b> - is the passband boundary frequency
                    which separates the passband from the transition band.
                <li><b>Passband edge frequency 2</b> - if the filter is a bandpass or a bandstop
                    filter,	then there are two transition bands. In that case passband edge
                    frequency 1 separates the passband from the first transition band (and
                    its frequency is lower), and the second passband edge frequency separates
                    the passband from the second transition band.
                <li><b>Stopband edge frequency 1</b> - is the edge frequency which is the
                    boundary between the stopband and the transition band in the filter's
                    frequency response.
                <li><b>Stopband edge frequency 2</b> - if the filter is bandpass or bandstop,
                    then there are two transition bands. In that case stopband edge frequency 1
                    separates the stopband from the first transition band (and its frequency is
                    lower), and the second passband edge frequency separates the passband from the
                    second transition band.
                <li><b>Passband ripple</b> - is the maximum frequency response fluctuations
                    which is allowed in the passband. For all frequencies in the passband, their
                    attenuation must be less or equal than the value set by this control.
                <li><b>Stopband attenuation</b> - the minimum attenuation in the stopband.
                    For all frequencies in the stopband, their frequency response magnitude must be
                    attenuated at least by the value set by this control.
            </ul>

            <p>The image below presents a frequency response of a Chebyshev I high-pass filter.
                The filter was designed using the following parameters:

            <ul>
                <li><b>Filter type</b> = high-pass</li>
                <li><b>Filter family</b> = Chebyshev I</li>
                <li><b>Passband edge frequency 1</b> = 20 Hz</li>
                <li><b>Stopband edge frequency 1</b> = 16 Hz</li>
                <li><b>Passband ripple</b> = 3 dB</li>
                <li><b>Stopband attenuation</b> = 40 dB</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please note that the frequency response shown fulfills the requirements given.
                For example - the stopband ends at 16 Hz and all frequencies in the stopband are
                attenuated by at least 40 dB. The passband begins at 20 Hz and all frequencies in
                the passband are attenuated - at most - by 3 dB.</p>

            <img src="images/highpassFilterFrequencyResponse.png" alt="High-pass Chebyshev I
                 filter, passband edge frequency 1 = 16 Hz, stopband edge frequency 1 = 20 Hz,
                 passband ripple = 3 dB, stopband attenuation = 40dB"/>

            <p>An analogous frequency response graph for a band-stop filter would have two
                passbands (first: from 0 Hz to passband edge frequency 1, second: begins at passband
                edge frequency 2), one stopband (from stopband edge frequency 1 to stopband edge
                frequency 2), and two transition bands. A frequency response graph for a band-pass
                filter will have two stopbands, one passband, and two transition bands</p>

            <p><b>Important - the maximum frequency that can be set using the frequency
                    controls is the Nyquist frequency which is equal to the half of the
                    signal's sampling frequency.</b></p>

            <h2>Drawing filter frequency response</h2>

            <p>A filter frequency response is a graph showing the filter's output spectrum,
                that is - how much is each frequency's magnitude attenuated in the signal
                which passes through the filter</p>

            <p>To draw the frequency response of the filter designed using the controls
                in the Filter parameters panel, press the "Draw filter frequency response"
                button.</p>

            <p>If the filter parameters are correct, the filter frequency response is drawn.
                Otherwise, a dialog containing error message is shown.</p>

            <h2>Error messages</h2>

            <p>The most common error message says that the designed filter order is too big.
                This happens, when the filter parameters are too strict. The more strict the
                parameters are, the harder for the designer is to design a filter fulfilling
                the specification given. For example - it is very hard for the designer to
                design a filter having very narrow transition bands (a transition band is
                narrow when a passband edge frequency is very close to the corresponding
                stopband edge frequency), a very small value of ripple in the passband and
                having all of the frequencies in the stopband strongly attenuated.</p>

            <p>If such an error shows up, please make the parameters less strict.</p>

            <p>Another solution for that error is changing the Filter family of the filter.
                Filters approximated using the Chebyshev approximation functions tend to have
                smaller filter order comparing
                to Buttorworth filters having similar filter parameters. What's more, filters
                approximated using the Elliptic functions have smaller filter order
                comparing to a Chebyshev filter having similar parameters.</p>
