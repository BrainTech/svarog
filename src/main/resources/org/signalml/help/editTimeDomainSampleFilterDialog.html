<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This file describes how to create and edit time domain sample filters using this dialog.</p>

<h2>Specyfying filter parameters</h2>

<p>To create or edit a filter, you need to specify the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Filter type</b> - describes what type of filter you want to design.<br/>
	Possible values:
	<ul>
	    <li>low-pass</li>
	    <li>high-pass</li>
	    <li>band-pass</li>
	    <li>band-stop</li>
	</ul>
    <li><b>Filter family</b> - describes what is the type of approximation
	function used to calculate the coefficients of this filter.<br/>
	Possible values:
	<ul>
	    <li>Butterworth</li>
	    <li>Chebyshev I</li>
	    <li>Chebyshev II</li>
	    <li>Elliptic</li>
	</ul>
    <li><b>Passband edge frequency 1</b> - is the passband boundary frequency
	which separates the passband from transition band.
    <li><b>Passband edge frequency 2</b> - if the filter is bandpass or bandstop,
	then there are two transition bands. In that case passband edge frequency 1
	separates the passband from the first transition band (and its frequency is
	lower), and the second passband edge frequency separates the passband from the
	second transition band.
    <li><b>Stopband edge frequency 1</b> - is the edge frequency which is the
	boundary between the stopband and the transition band in the filter's required
	frequency response.
    <li><b>Stopband edge frequency 2</b> - if the filter is bandpass or bandstop,
	then there are two transition bands. In that case stopband edge frequency 1
	separates the stopband from the first transition band (and its frequency is
	lower), and the second passband edge frequency separates the passband from the
	second transition band.
    <li><b>Passband ripple</b> - is the maximum frequency response fluctuations
	which is allowed in the passband. For all frequencies in the passband, their
	attenuation must be at less or equal to the value set by this control.
    <li><b>Stopband attenuation</b> - the minimum attenuation in the stopband.
	For all frequencies in the stopband, their frequency response magnitude must be
	attenuated at least by the value set by this control.
</ul>

<p>The image below presents a frequency response of a Chebyshev I high-pass filter.
The filter was designed for the following parameters:

<ul>
    <li><b>Filter type</b> = high-pass</li>
    <li><b>Filter family</b> = Chebyshev I</li>
    <li><b>Passband edge frequency 1</b> = 20 Hz</li>
    <li><b>Stopband edge frequency 1</b> = 16 Hz</li>
    <li><b>Passband ripple</b> = 3 dB</li>
    <li><b>Stopband attenuation</b> = 40 dB</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the frequency response given fulfills the requirements given.
For example - the stopband ends at 16 Hz and all frequencies in the stopband are
attenuated at least 40 dB. The passband begins at 20 Hz and all frequencies in
the passband are attenuated at most by 3 dB.</p>

<img src="images/highpassFilterFrequencyResponse.png" alt="High-pass Chebyshev I
filter, passband edge frequency 1 = 16 Hz, stopband edge frequency 1 = 20 Hz,
passband ripple = 3 dB, stopband attenuation = 40dB"/>

<p>An analogous frequency response graph for a band-stop filter will have two
passbands (first: from 0 Hz to passband edge frequency 1, second: begins at passband
edge frequency 2), one stopband (from stopband edge frequency 1 to stopband edge
frequency 2), and two transition bands. A frequency response graph for a band-pass
filter will have two stopbands, one passband, and two transition bands</p>

<p><b>Important - the maximum frequency which can be specified using the frequency
controls in this dialog is the Nyquist frequency which is equal to the half of the
sampling frequency.</b></p>

<h2>Drawing filter frequency response</h2>

<p>The filter frequency response is a graph showing the filter's output spectrum,
    that is - how much each frequency's magnitude is attenuated in the signal
    which passes through the filter</p>

<p>To draw the frequency response of the filter designed using the controls
    in the Filter parameters panel, press the "Draw filter frequency response"
    button.</p>

<p>If the filter parameters are correct, the filter frequency response is drawn.
    Otherwise, a dialog containing error message is shown.</p>

<h2>Error messages</h2>

<p>The most common error message says that the designed filter order is too big.
    This happens, when the filter parameters are too strict. The more strict the
    parameters are, the harder for the designer is to design a filter fulfilling
    the specification given. For example - it is very hard for the designer to
    design a filter having very narrow transition bands (a transition band is
    narrow when a passband edge frequency is very close to the corresponding
    stopband edge frequency), a very small value of ripple in the passband and
    having all of the frequencies in the stopband strongly attenuated.</p>

<p>So, if such an error shows up, please make the parameters less strict
    (pay special attention to the narrowness of the transition band, because this
    is the most common problem).</p>

<p>You may also change the Filter family of the filter. Filters approximated
    with the Chebyshev functions tend to have smaller filter order comparing
    to a Buttorworth filter with similar filter parameters. Filters approximated
    using the Elliptic functions have smaller filter order comparing to a
    Chebyshev filter having similar parameters.</p>
